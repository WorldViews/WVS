  t:          A unix time stamp in seconds since epoc.
  position:   A [x,y] or [x,y,z] tuple.
  coordSys:   A coordinate system name.

The default coordinate system is "geo", and when it is used
the position tuple should be [lat, lng] or [lat,lng,alt].

Optional fields could be added, with things like notes, battery levels,
etc. associated with a position,
